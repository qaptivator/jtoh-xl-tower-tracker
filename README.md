## Update Log

### v0.1.0

Initial release (deployment 3, commit first public release)

- Shows every JXP tower that Roblox user had completed
- Sorting by area (r1, r2, r3, fr) or difficulty
- Percentage of how close is the area or difficulty to fully completion
- Total tower completition percentage
- Hardest completion and most recent completion

### v0.1.1

Tower data hotfix (deployment 4, commit tower data hotfix)

- Fixed the CoTC and CoIS difficulty
- Made the ToFM have the same badge as ToLW, because there isn't a badge for ToFM

### v0.1.2

Ring 4 towers (deployment 5-6, commit ring 4 update)

- Added new citadels from Ring 4

## TODO List

- [ ] Button for showing full name without having to hover over the acronyms
- [ ] Show locked/unlocked citadels and areas
- [ ] Menu for uncompleted towers
- [ ] Showing the tower's completion date somewhere
- [ ] Maybe combine all these things into a single filter menu? (like sort by name, difficulty, locked/unlocked, date of completion, ascending/descending)
- [x] RING 4 (when it releases)
- [ ] Indicator for checking did user even join JXP at all (could be useful for showing that the username is wrong)
- [ ] Dark mode
